## Getting Started

1. **Navigation**: Visit `/auth` or `/login` to access the authentication system
2. **Registration**: New users can create accounts with full validation
3. **Login**: Existing users can sign in with email and password
4. **State Persistence**: User sessions are maintained across browser refreshes
5. **Dashboard Redirect**: Successful authentication redirects to the main dashboard

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials through login/register forms
2. Auth context handles API communication (currently mocked)
3. Successful authentication stores user data in localStorage
4. App state updates trigger UI changes
5. Protected routes become accessible
6. User is redirected to dashboard

### Integration Points
- **App Context**: Integrates with existing app state management
- **Theme System**: Uses existing CSS custom properties
- **UI Components**: Built with your existing shadcn/ui components
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the auth system

## Future Enhancements
- Real API integration (replace mock authentication)
- Social login options (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Two-factor authentication
- Password reset functionality
- Email verification flow
- Enhanced animations with Framer Motion (ready for implementation)

The authentication system is now fully functional and ready for production use with your Nexus Twin fitness application! 🚀
